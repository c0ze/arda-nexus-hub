          <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
            I've been living in <span className="text-primary font-medium">Japan since 2004</span>, where I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from Keio University (2006-2008). I also pursued PhD studies in Embedded Processor Design and Optimization from 2008-2011.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
            With over <span className="text-primary font-medium">20 years of professional experience</span>, I've worked across the full technology stack - from embedded systems to cloud architecture. Currently serving as a Systems Architect at Veltra since 2024, I specialize in migrating monolithic applications to microservices and building scalable infrastructure solutions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
            My journey has taken me through various roles at companies like Gaussy, Robotfund, and Mobilous, always focusing on pragmatic solutions and continuous learning.
